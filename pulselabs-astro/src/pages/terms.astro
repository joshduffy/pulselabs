      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using any PulseLab application ("App"), including Sync and Ember,
        you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use our Apps.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        PulseLab provides privacy-first health tracking applications. Our Apps are designed to store all
        data locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal
        health data.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Privacy and Data</h2>
      <p>
        Your privacy is fundamental to our service. Our Apps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store all data locally on your device only</li>
        <li>Do not transmit any data to our servers</li>
        <li>Do not collect analytics or usage data</li>
        <li>Do not contain advertisements</li>
        <li>Do not share data with third parties</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For detailed information about how each App handles your data, please see the individual
        privacy policies for <a href="/sync/privacy">Sync</a> and <a href="/ember/privacy">Ember</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>4. License and Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        When you purchase an App, you receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the
        App on devices you own or control, subject to these Terms. This is a one-time purchase that
        grants you perpetual use of the purchased version.
      </p>
      <p>
        PulseLab retains all intellectual property rights in the Apps, including copyrights, trademarks,
        and any other proprietary rights.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Our Apps are not medical devices and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or
        prevent any disease or health condition.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The information provided by our Apps is for general informational purposes only. It is not
        a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice
        of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding
        a medical condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you
        have read or tracked in our Apps.
      </p>

      <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Apps only for their intended purpose</li>
        <li>Not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Apps</li>
        <li>Not use the Apps for any unlawful purpose</li>
        <li>Keep your device and any App data secure</li>
        <li>Maintain backups of any data important to you (data stored only on your device may be lost if the device is damaged, lost, or reset)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Data Loss</h2>
      <p>
        Because all data is stored locally on your device, you are responsible for backing up your
        data. PulseLab is not responsible for any data loss resulting from device damage, loss, theft,
        software issues, or any other cause.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, PulseLab shall not be liable for any indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues,
        whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other
        intangible losses resulting from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your use or inability to use the Apps</li>
        <li>Any unauthorized access to or use of your device</li>
        <li>Any errors or omissions in the Apps</li>
        <li>Any other matter relating to the Apps</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Refund policies are governed by the app store through which you purchased the App (Apple App
        Store or Google Play Store). Please contact the respective app store for refund requests.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Updates and Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Apps from time to time. While we strive to maintain backward compatibility,
        we cannot guarantee that all features will remain unchanged. We may also update these Terms
        of Service; continued use of the Apps after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using our Apps at any time. Since all data is stored locally on your device,
        uninstalling the App will remove all associated data.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States,
        without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
      </p>
